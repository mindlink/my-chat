/*  07.10.2020
    CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY: As specified by MindLink Readme.md (any exceptions to that can be found below)
    Current tested functionality: Please see ConversationExporterTests class.

    FUTURE WORK:
            1) Exceptions, exceptions, exceptions!
               Improve Exception throwing and handling in all modules and functions.
            2) Organize files in project (eg. put test .txt files in separate folder)
            3) Include functionality for handling strange input formats.
               For instance: Although multiple white spaces, tabs and new lines can been handled
               when at beginning or end of messages and conversation,
               they are not handled when separating the timestamp, message and sender.
               eg. 1448470901      bob Hello there! :fails
               Possible fix: Use a better regular expression that matches multiple white spaces followed by character
            4) Specifications say replace with /*redacted*/
/*            I am replacing with *redacted* because for some reason my escape \\ character on the backslash does not work.
              Fix that.
            5) Make report generation more efficient (double nested for loops probably not the most efficient way)
            6) Extend functionality to list of user names and keywords instead of single ones
            7) Extend functionality to more report metrics offered
            8) Create automatically generated random inputs to feed into the
               parameterized testing functions.
            9) Include more property-based tests. For instance, a property of the
               filterByKeyword and hideWords functions is that at the output file
               one should never find those words. That could be a property test.


    Things I am not certain about and I would therefore ask help for:
        1) Why inner class InstantSerializer needs to be static? Is it okay to be static?
        2) Copyright issues for the idea I took from
            https://www.code4copy.com/java/compare-two-text-file-in-java/
        3) Specifications unclear on case sensitivity. My filtering is case sensitive.
           In real-life though I would guess that blackListed word filtering should be case insensitive,
           since the meaning of the word does not change with capital letters or small ones.
        4) Design choices:
                     - Putting all functions to abstract class Utilities
                     - making many methods static
                     - Having multiple open IO streams
